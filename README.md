# FlappyBird
Trying to make Flappy Bird in Java :D

## Why Flappy Bird?
I had learned Java in high school, but most of my university career until second semester of second year was spent coding in Pythone exclusively. Trying to return to Java turned out to be quite hard because frankly, I forgot a lot of the syntax! Flappy Bird seemed like the perfect project to review all the aspects of Java and its syntax (ie how to define member access, constructors, inheritance syntax, etc).

## Ideas for the future
* train the flappy bird with a neural net!
* VR + EMG + physical feedback

## Todo List
* figure out how to access images in .jar
* add points system
* fix bug in crash detection system (some cases birdie should die but it doesn't :( )
